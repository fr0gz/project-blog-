I'm a business major at FEN, U de Chile, that's located at Santiago de Chile.

In my country we call "Ingenieria Comercial", and that's a kind of tricky name: indeed, it's 
a little more rough than pure business, but it is not engineering in the traditional sense of
the word.

So, to make my CV more engineering like, i'm doing this blog where i post some of my tech 
projects, opinions, press that i like to read and stuff like that.
